ros-indigo-abb-driver (1.1.3-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * driver: reintroduce coupling factor default.
    Reverts 3765cd6.
  * Bump versions.
  * driver: remove default for J23 coupling parameter.
    Users should explicitly provide this on the command line, or use one
    of the convenience launchfiles provided with the support packages.
    It is of critical importance that this parameter is set to the
    correct value, and should therefore not be supplied a default in
    a (for end-users) file with low visibility.
  * driver: move driver (Rapid and nodes) into separate package.
    Node sources, headers and launch files copied from abb_common.
