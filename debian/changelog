ros-hydro-abb-common (1.1.3-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * Merged changes from hydro (release) branch.  Changes include only release artifacts
  * Add deprecation notice to old packages.
    And point users to the replacements.
  * common: add roslaunch testing.
    In preparation of repository refactoring: roslaunch tests will be
    used to perform regression testing to make sure all changes remain
    backward compatible (wrt executable artefacts, resources and launch
    files).
