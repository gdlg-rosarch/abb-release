  * moveit_cfg: make warehouse db location user configurable.
    Fix #58 <https://github.com/Aequitas82/abb/issues/58>.
    Released MoveIt configuration packages are installed in non-writable
    locations most of the time. Starting demo.launch or any other launch
    file that starts the mongodb wrapper script results in a 'Permission
    denied' error, as it cannot create the database in those directories.
    These changes allow the user to configure an alternative location
    for the mongodb database by using the db_path argument.
    Essentially a backport of the fix in ros-planning/moveit_setup_assistant #103 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_setup_assistant/issues/103>.
    These fixes have been applied to both the new and the deprecated MoveIt
    configuration packages.
